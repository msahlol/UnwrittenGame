# UnwrittenGame
Welcome to Unwritten! What it is about all depends on how you write your story.

To fully experience the different features in this game, we recommend playing the game a few times to see:
1. The 2 different ability types
2. The 4 different abilities per ability type
3. The 5 different enemies with different types
4. The health pickups
5. The mana pickups
6. The different choices you can make and their outcomes

We are very proud of the game we have made. After about a month and a half between 3 people, we have been able to build a full game from the original prototype.

Althought we will expand about this furhter in the final report, our group had an added handicap since 2/3 of our group members had no prior game dev experience prior to this course. They also had to learn unity specifically for this game.

Some of tasks/features that a significant amount of work went into are:
1. Learning unity
2. Creating unique enemies with different specs, powers, and types
3. Creating unique abilities with different specs and behavious
4. Creating the animation for the charge, use, and destroy action of each ability
5. Creating the enemy AI that includes a field of view that is interrupted by obstructions, following the player, attacking the player, and looking back at their spawn once they have lost sight of the player
6. Creating health/mana resources and the dynamic GUI interface that displays the player's stats
7. Creating the terrain and populating it with greenery

If this gets handed in a little late, we are sorry! We started the submission process before 10:45 but between github being silly, the builld taking forever, and making backups taking even longer, somehow over an hour was not enough time for this. We really did try our best and it was disheartening to have that effort go to waste. We were niave gamers who did not know that it takes this long to submit a unity game.
